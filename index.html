            <p>I work at <a href="asana.com" target="blank">Asana</a> as a Product Engineer in San Francisco.</p>
            <p>I graduated from <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/" target="blank">Brown University</a> in May 2020 where I worked as a Teaching Assistant for a few courses (<a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0330/" target="blank">CS33</a>, <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0112/spring-2020/" target="blank">CS112</a>) and was a Head Teaching Assistant for <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0180/">CS18</a>. I was also a <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/about/diversity/">Diversity Advocate</a> for my department.</p>
            <p>During my senior year at Brown I worked on a research project with the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/" target="blank">Sheridan Center</a> to study the experience of STEM Teaching Assistants at Brown and create new institution-wide guidelines for these student workers.</p>
